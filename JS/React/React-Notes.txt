in single js file we can create n components but only one default component, default has to be there
for default components at the time of import we can give any reference name.
import App from './App'; 
or
import Appref from './App';

any one default export is fine

1.export default function App() {}
2.export default App;

Remaining are non default components
Reference name should be same, import { C2, C3 } from './App';
should be in {C2, C3}
import Appref, {C2, C3 } from './App';
or
import {C2, C3} from './App';
*** if we don't use {C2} it calls default component twice.

component latter should start with UpperCase

from "./fileName"
components are defined in js file so no need define file extensions

in function  return (only one root shoulbe there 
<div>
here we can define any num of div tags
</div>) 

not allowed 
function  return (only one root shoulbe there <div></div> <div></div>)
